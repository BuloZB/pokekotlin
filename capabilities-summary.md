# AI Assistant Capabilities Summary

## Web Access

I **do not** have direct web access capabilities. This means I cannot:

- Browse websites in real-time
- Fetch documentation from online sources
- Access APIs or external services
- Download resources from the internet

## Documentation Assistance Capabilities

Despite not having web access, I can help with KDoc documentation in the
following ways:

### Knowledge-Based Documentation

- I have extensive knowledge about Kotlin, KDoc syntax, and documentation best
  practices
- I can generate KDoc comments based on code analysis and my existing knowledge
- I can follow standard documentation patterns for Kotlin/Java libraries

### Code Analysis

- I can analyze your codebase to understand functions, classes, and their
  relationships
- I can suggest appropriate documentation based on parameter types, return
  values, and function behavior
- I can identify public APIs that should be prioritized for documentation

### Documentation Formatting

- I can format KDoc comments following standard conventions
- I can create consistent documentation across your codebase
- I can include proper section tags (@param, @return, @throws, etc.)

## Available Commands

I can execute various commands to help with documentation tasks:

### File Operations

- `search_project`: Search for specific terms or patterns in the codebase
- `get_file_structure`: Display the structure of a file (classes, methods, etc.)
- `open`/`open_entire_file`: View file contents
- `create`: Create new files
- `search_replace`: Make edits to existing files

### Testing & Verification

- `run_test`: Execute tests to verify functionality
- `build`: Build the project
- `run_android_app`: Run Android applications
- `display_compose_preview`: View Compose UI previews

## Workflow for Documentation Tasks

Here's how we can work together on documentation:

1. **Code Analysis**: I'll analyze your code to understand what needs
   documentation
2. **Documentation Draft**: I'll create KDoc comments based on code behavior
3. **Review & Refinement**: You can review and provide feedback on the
   documentation
4. **Implementation**: I'll apply the documentation to your codebase

## Limitations

- I cannot access online documentation for PokeAPI or other services
- I cannot fetch the latest documentation standards from external sources
- Any references to external libraries or APIs will be based on my training
  knowledge, which may not reflect the most current versions

If you need documentation that requires current web information, you may need to
provide those details to me directly.
